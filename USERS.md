Who is using JRuby?
====================

Sharing experiences and learning from other users is essential. We are
frequently asked who is using a particular feature of JRuby so people can get in
contact with other users to share experiences and best practices. People
also often want to know if product/platform X supports JRuby.
While the [JRuby Matrix community](https://matrix.to/#/#jruby:matrix.org) allows
users to get in touch, it can be challenging to find this information quickly.

The following is a directory of adopters to help identify users of individual
features. The users themselves directly maintain the list.

Adding yourself as a user
-------------------------

If you are using JRuby or it is integrated into your product, service, or
platform, please consider adding yourself as a user with a quick
description of your use case by [opening a pull request to this file](https://github.com/jruby/jruby/blob/master/USERS.md)
and adding a section describing your usage of JRuby:

If you are open to others contacting you about your use of JRuby, add your
Matrix nickname or contact info as well.

Requirements to be listed
-------------------------

 * You must represent the user listed. Do *NOT* add entries on behalf of
   other users.
 * There is no minimum deployment size but we request to list permanent
   production deployments only, i.e., no demo or trial deployments. Commercial
   use is not required. A well-done home lab setup can be equally
   interesting as a large-scale commercial deployment.
